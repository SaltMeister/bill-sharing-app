# App feautures
1) Send money to other users, integrated into bank account
2) User can take picture of receipt -> user can upload pic of receipt, display list of items purchased, different users can choose to pay for whatever items and be able to split individual items between users
3) Create groups of users that want to split a bill

## Goals by next week
1) Create a mock up of the app (Josh)
2) Block out mock ups in the code
3) Getting Stripe API to work through testing (Vedant)
4) Research ML to learn more about how to get receipts from camera (Diego)
5) Setting up backend API along with database (Simon)
