3) Create groups of users that want to split a bill

# Goals by next week
1) Create a mock up of the app (Josh)
2) Block out mock ups in the code
3) Getting Stripe API to work through testing (Vedant)
4) Research ML to learn more about how to get receipts from camera (Diego)
5) Setting up backend API along with database (Simon)
